# Final_exam.R Analysis

This R script performs various data analysis tasks, likely as part of an exam or practice exercise. Below is a summary of the key steps and analyses performed:

### Library Imports
- Imported essential libraries such as `data.table` and `tidyverse`.
- Installed and loaded the `nycflights13` package.

### Questions and Analyses
- **Q2**: Calculated the mean distance of flights in the `nycflights13` dataset.
- **Q3**: Loaded the `cars` dataset.
- **Q4**: Created sequences and performed element-wise multiplication, extracting a specific element.
- **Q5**: Calculated the median petal width of the `iris` dataset.
- **Q18**: Filtered flights originating from JFK and calculated the mean distance.
- **Q19**: Filtered flights in June and sorted destinations by frequency.
- **Q20**: Calculated the average number of seats on planes that left from NYC on July 4, using a join between `flights` and `planes` datasets.
- **Q22**: Generated a summary of the `flights` dataset.
- **Q24**: Performed a t-test comparing `Sepal.Width` across species in the `iris` dataset for versicolor and virginica species.
- **Q25**: Converted the `flights` dataset to a data frame and generated a summary.
- **Q26**: Used `grepl()` to search for a pattern in a character vector.
- **Q27**: Created a data table and calculated the mean of a column grouped by another column.
- **Q28**: Used `paste()` to concatenate sequences with specified separators.

## Key Findings
- Successfully performed a variety of data manipulation and statistical analysis tasks.
- Demonstrated proficiency in using R for data filtering, summarization, and hypothesis testing.
- Showcased the ability to join datasets and perform complex queries.

This summary encapsulates the major components and findings of the analysis. For detailed code and results, please refer to the specific sections in the script.
